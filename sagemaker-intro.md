## Amazon SageMaker Intro

Amazon SageMaker is an AWS service where we can create our own Jupyter Notebooks, on the AWS Cloud, and then use them to analyze our data and bulid machine learning models.

There's an option to select a small instance type (virtual processor) to run the Jupyter notebook, and a more powerful instance (virtual CPU or GPU) for training our machine learning and deep learning models.

SageMaker provides the necessary processing power for analysing large datasets and for creating machine learning and deep learning models whenever the local processing power is not enough.

And the advantage is that we can use Jupyter notebooks on our local machine to start our data analysis process and when we need more processing power, we can upload our data and Jupyter notebooks to SageMaker and continue our analysis.

There's also an option to clone any GitHub repository to SageMaker and use the Jupyter notebooks in that repo. Also, we can configure SageMaker to export the results to our own private GitHub repository.

Thus, we can clone any public repository but we can export the results only to our own private repository.
