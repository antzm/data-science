# t-test statistics

Examples on t-test statictics

Example 1: We randomly ask 50 students about their grades in mathematics. Based on that sample, we would like to draw some conclusions about the grades of all the students in a specific city (our population consists of all the students in the city, but we don’t have official data about their grades neither we have the ability to ask every single student in the city).
We construct e.g. the following hypothesis testing (let’s assume we read that in some other city, the mean grade is 75 and we would like to test if the students in our city have statistically the same grade or not):
Null hypothesis:
Η0: μ = 75
Alternative hypothesis:
Η1: μ <> 75
Reminder: μ is a Greek letter and so it refers to the population, as Greek letters in statistics refer to the population. On the other hand, the x bar refers to the sample, as English letters in statistics refer to the sample.
So, in this case, we are using a one-sample t-test to draw our conclusions.

Example 2: We ask 10 students from school A, and another 10 students from school B, about their grades in mathematics. We would like to compare the grades of those two schools. Now we have two populations. One population consists of all the students in school A, while the other population consists of all the students in school B.
We construct the following hypothesis testing:
H0: μ1 = μ2
Η1: μ1 <> μ2
In this case, we are using a two-sample t-test to draw our conclusions.
