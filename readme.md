# Data Science


## Introduction

This is a repository with various information on Data Science. The purpose is to share some interesting, and hopefully useful information, about Data Science.

All the information included, has been 

Firstly, it contains basic information on statistics and then, provides basic information about some of the tools that are used in data science. There several tools that can be used in data scinece and thus, this repo includes just a few of those tools.

There are various programs that can be used for Data Analysis and Data Science but this repo will focus mostly on the open ware solutions that are available to data analysta and data scientists.


## Data analysis vs data science

Many people think that the terms Data Analysis and Data Science are the same thing. Actually, they have many things in common but thereâ€™s also a fundamental difference between them:

* Data Analysis is using existing data to describe exclusively what happened in the past.

* Data Science though, is using existing data not only to describe what happened in the past, but also, it uses those data in a scientfic way that allows to estimate the future tendencies.


## Data sources

The data we need to analyze, may come from different sources. They could be existing data, or we may need to create our own "experiment" in order to collect the data we need. This "experiment" could ne an actual scientific experiment or even a questionaire, that has to be filled in order to select the neccesary data.

The data we will be using for our analysis, would be either structured data, which are well organized data in the form of tables, or unstructured data that have to go through a lot of processing in order to be tranformed into structured data. Examples of structured data are the SQL databases, while unstructured data are the various post on the social media.

Between those two types, there are also the semi-structured data that need some kind of processing to become structured data. This could include, for example, log files, JSON files and HTML files.


## Probablility and Statistics

To become a good Data Scientist, someone should first understand the important statistical concepts that are used in Data Science. In fact, the better someone can understand the true meaning of the various statisitical concepts, the better data scientist will be. 

As susch, a detailed introduction to some basic concepts of statistics has been prepared.


## Linear Algebra

Another useful knowledge in Data Science, is a basic understanding of linear algebra. This includes matrices and understanding the calculations with matrices.

Matrices calculations is an iportant part of data science, especially in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. For this reason, an essential understanding of those topics very udseful, 


## Python

Python is the most widely used programming language in data science. Although other languages could also be used, Python has some great advantages compared to other languages, and this is mainly due the great libraries that are available for working with data.

For this reason, a short introduction to Python is included in this repository.


## Python libraries

Some of the moste important Pyton libraries in data science are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

Some basic information on a few Python libraries is included in this repository.


## R

The statistical language R, was once considered a neccesary knowldedge for data scientists but nowadays, Python provides more flexibility through numerous libraries and packages that cover almost every data scientist need.


## SQL

The Stuctured Query Language (SQL) is used to extract information from data that are stored in relational databases, like the mySQL and PostgreSQL data bases. It's an important skill that the data scientists should have in order to be able to extract the data they want from a data base and then analyze those data.


## Git Bash

Git bash provides a command line interface to data scientist which allows to collaborate with other data scientists and, between other things, to also upload ans share their work on GitHUb.


## Machine learning algorithms

In data science, we use existing data to scientifically predict future trends. The most modern way to accomplish this, is by using various machine learning algorithms and methods. Thus, a thorough understanding of machine learning is essential in data science.


## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is the creation of a multi layer neural network that can be used for image recognition, natural language processing, plagiarism detector, sentiment analysis etc.

Deep learing is part of machine learning but we could say that is something more demanding and specialized.


## Cloud computing

It's almost impossible to use an average modern computer for very demanding computations. For this reason, everyone in fhe field of data science must have a very good knowledge of at least one cloud computing platform, which will provide the means for analysing demanding data sets and creating machine learning models.

For this reason, a brief introduction to AWS SageMaker is included, as a starting point for analyzing data on the AWS cloud.


## Writing skills

As a data scientist, someone has to write a lot of reports to explain the results that she or has find. This means that a data scientist has to be really good in expressing in a concise and effective way the various results.

It's absolutely meaningless if an excellent data scientist discovers extraordinary things while working with data and not to be able to coomunicate his or her findings.

Our writing skills imporove not only as we write more but most importantly, when we read more. Thus, a data scientist should always take a chance to read more literature and not only data science books.

Also, for many data scientists, English is not their first language but they may need to present reports in English and for this reason, they should also practise by reading English books and writing texts whenever possible.
