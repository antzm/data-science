## Introduction

This is a repository with various information on Data Science. The purpose is to share some interesting, and hopefully useful information, about Data Science.

Many people think that the terms Data Analysis and Data Science are the same thing. Actually, they have many things in common but thereâ€™s also a fundamental difference between them:

* Data Analysis is using existing data to describe exclusively what happened in the past.

* Data Science though, is using existing data not only to describe what happened in the past, but also, it uses those data in a scientfic way that allows to estimate the future tendencies.
