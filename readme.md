# Data Science


## Introduction

This is a repository with various information on Data Science. The purpose is to share some interesting, and hopefully useful information, about Data Science and to provide some basic form of guidance to everyone who starts his or her own journey in the data field.

All the information included, has been created specifically for this repository and has been written litle by litle for a period of several weeks.

Firstly, it contains basic information on statistics and then, provides basic information about some of the tools that are used in data science. There are several tools that can be used in data scinece and thus, this repo includes just a few of those tools.

There are various software programs that can be used for Data Analysis and Data Science, but this repo focuses mostly on the open source solutions that are available to data analysts and data scientists.


## Data analysis vs data science

Many people think that the terms Data Analysis and Data Science are the same thing. Actually, they have many things in common but thereâ€™s also a fundamental difference between them:

* Data Analysis is using existing data to describe exclusively what happened in the past.

* Data Science though, is using existing data not only to describe what happened in the past, but also, it uses those data in a scientfic way that allows to estimate the future tendencies.


## Data sources

The data we need to analyze, may come from different sources. They could be existing data, or we may need to create our own "experiment" in order to collect the data we need. This "experiment" could ne an actual scientific experiment or even a questionaire, that has to be filled in order to select the neccesary data.

The data we will be using for our analysis, would be either structured data, which are well organized data in the form of tables, or unstructured data that have to go through a lot of processing in order to be tranformed into structured data. Examples of structured data are the SQL databases, while unstructured data are the various post on the social media.

Between those two types, there are also the semi-structured data that need some kind of processing to become structured data. This could include, for example, log files, JSON files and HTML files.


## Cleaning the Data

Usually, the data we are going to use for our data analysis, firstly, they need to be cleaned thus, making sure that our data have the proper format and that our variable types are consistent throughout our our dataset.


## Missing data

This a great field for controversy as there are several opinions on how to handle the missing data in our dataset.
The most important thing though, is to make our own decision and at the same time being able to explain the exact reasons that lead us to that particular decision.

As we examine and analyze a dataset, we are getting a better understaning of our data and this can lead us to better decisions on how to handle the missing data. Otherwise, just selecting an option that we read somewhere, will not be the best option.


## Probablility and Statistics

To become a good Data Scientist, someone should first understand the important statistical concepts that are used in Data Science. In fact, the better someone can understand the true meaning of the various statisitical concepts, the better data scientist will be.

As susch, a detailed introduction to some basic concepts of statistics has been prepared.


## Linear Algebra

Another useful knowledge in Data Science, is a basic understanding of linear algebra. This includes matrices and understanding the calculations with matrices.

Matrices calculations is an iportant part of data science, especially in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. For this reason, an essential understanding of those topics would very udseful.

Also, understanding vector and vector spaces is something which helps the understaning of many machine learning and deep learning algorithms.


## Calculus

A basic knowledge of calculus is helpful as it makes it easier to understand the various probability distributions.


## Python

Python is the most widely used programming language in data science. Although other languages could also be used, Python has some great advantages compared to other languages, and this is mainly due the great libraries that are available for working with data.

For this reason, a short introduction to Python is included in this repository.


## Python libraries

Some of the moste important Pyton libraries in data science are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

Some basic information on a few Python libraries is included in this repository.


## R

The statistical language R, was once considered a neccesary knowldedge for data scientists but nowadays, Python provides more flexibility through numerous libraries and packages that cover almost every data scientist need.

If though someone is only interested mostly in statistics, it could be easier to learn the programming language R which is great as it was created by statisticians but lack the flexibility of a real programming language like Python.


## SQL

The Stuctured Query Language (SQL) is used to extract information from data that are stored in relational databases, like the mySQL and PostgreSQL data bases. It's an important skill that the data scientists should have in order to be able to extract the data they want from a data base and then analyze those data.


## Git Bash

Git bash provides a command line interface to data scientist which allows to collaborate with other data scientists and, between other things, to also upload ans share their work on GitHUb.


## Machine learning algorithms

In data science, we use existing data to scientifically predict future trends. The most modern way to accomplish this, is by using various machine learning algorithms and methods. Thus, a thorough understanding of machine learning is essential in data science.


## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is the creation of a multi layer neural network that can be used for image recognition, natural language processing, plagiarism detector, sentiment analysis etc.

Deep learing is part of machine learning but we could say that is something more demanding and specialized.


## Cloud computing

It's almost impossible to use an average modern computer for very demanding computations. For this reason, everyone in fhe field of data science must have a very good knowledge of at least one cloud computing platform, which will provide the means for analysing demanding data sets and creating machine learning models.

For this reason, a brief introduction to AWS SageMaker is included, as a starting point for analyzing data on the AWS cloud.


## Writing skills

As a data scientist, someone has to write a lot of reports to explain the results that she or has find. This means that a data scientist has to be really good in expressing in a concise and effective way the various results.

It's absolutely meaningless if an excellent data scientist discovers extraordinary things while working with data and not to be able to coomunicate his or her findings.

Our writing skills imporove not only as we write more but most importantly, when we read more. Thus, a data scientist should always take a chance to read more literature and not only data science books.

Also, for many data scientists, English is not their first language but they may need to present reports in English and for this reason, they should also practise by reading English books and writing texts whenever possible.


## Presentaiton skills

A Data Scientist does not only analyzes the data and presents his or her results in writing, but should also be able to presnent in an effective way his or her findings.

The main difficulty though lies in the fact, that, most of the thimes, the audience would not have any data scientist background. For this exact reason, the data scientist should be able to effectively communicate the findings to different audiences and adapt respectively the style of the presentation so that anyone would be able to understand and get the most out of the findings.


## Learning Techniques

While learning new things on Data Science, it would be useful to apply some well proven and effective methods to better assimilate and understand the new material. Thus, to be able to effectively practice and apply, step by step, this new knowledge.

There is a tremendous amount of available material on any aspect of Data Science that someone would like to study and in any depth they prefer to study.

For that reason, it is easy to get lost in the way by focusing on things which are less important or less relevant.

To avoid such situations, someone need to decide in advance what are the most important topics that would like to study and then to procedd by studying only those topics. At a later time, when those topics have been approached and understood, it's time to proceed with some ne topics.

But approaching too many topics simultaneously, it would be something overwhelming and not so useful for the overall understanding of Data Science.
