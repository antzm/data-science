# Data Science
 
## Introduction

This is a repository with various information on Data Science. The purpose is to share some interesting, and hopefully useful information, about Data Science.

Many people think that the terms Data Analysis and Data Science are the same thing. Actually, they have many things in common but thereâ€™s also a fundamental difference between them:

* Data Analysis is using existing data to describe exclusively what happened in the past.

* Data Science though, is using existing data not only to describe what happened in the past, but also, it uses those data in a scientfic way that allows to estimate the future tendencies.


## Probablility and Statistics

To become a good Data Scientist, someone should first understand the important statistical concepts that are used in Data Science. In fact, the better someone can understand the true meaning of the various statisitical concepts, the better data scientist will be. 

## Linear Algebra

Another useful knowledge in Data Science, is a basic understanding of linear algebra. This includes matrices and understanding the calculations with matrices.

## Python

Python is the most widely used programming language in data science. Although other languages could also be used, Python has some great advantages compared to other languages, and this is mainly due the great libraries that are available for working with data.

## Python libraries

Some of the moste important Pyton libraries in data science are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Machine learning algorithms

In data science, we use existing data to scientifically predict future trends. The most modern way to accomplish this, is by using various machine learning algorithms and methods. Thus, a thorough understanding of machine learning is essential in data science.

## Cloud computing

It's almost impossible to use an average modern computer for very demanding computations. For this reason, everyone in fhe field of data science must have a very good knowledge of at least one cloud computing platform, which will provide the means for analysing demanding data sets and creating machine learning models.
