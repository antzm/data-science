# Data Science


## Introduction

This is a repository with various information on Data Science. The purpose is to share some interesting, and hopefully useful information, about Data Science.

All the information included, has been 

Firstly, it contains basic information on statistics and then, provides basic information about some of the tools that are used in data science. There several tools that can be used in data scinece and thus, this repo includes just a few of those tools.

There are various programs that can be used for Data Analysis and Data Science but this repo will focus mostly on the open ware solutions that are available to data analysta and data scientists.


## Data analysis vs data science

Many people think that the terms Data Analysis and Data Science are the same thing. Actually, they have many things in common but thereâ€™s also a fundamental difference between them:

* Data Analysis is using existing data to describe exclusively what happened in the past.

* Data Science though, is using existing data not only to describe what happened in the past, but also, it uses those data in a scientfic way that allows to estimate the future tendencies.


## Probablility and Statistics

To become a good Data Scientist, someone should first understand the important statistical concepts that are used in Data Science. In fact, the better someone can understand the true meaning of the various statisitical concepts, the better data scientist will be. 

As susch, a detailed introduction to some basic concepts of statistics has been prepared.


## Linear Algebra

Another useful knowledge in Data Science, is a basic understanding of linear algebra. This includes matrices and understanding the calculations with matrices.


## Python

Python is the most widely used programming language in data science. Although other languages could also be used, Python has some great advantages compared to other languages, and this is mainly due the great libraries that are available for working with data.

For this reason, a short introduction to Python is included in this repository.


## Python libraries

Some of the moste important Pyton libraries in data science are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

Some basic information on a few Python libraries is included in this repository.


## Machine learning algorithms

In data science, we use existing data to scientifically predict future trends. The most modern way to accomplish this, is by using various machine learning algorithms and methods. Thus, a thorough understanding of machine learning is essential in data science.


## Cloud computing

It's almost impossible to use an average modern computer for very demanding computations. For this reason, everyone in fhe field of data science must have a very good knowledge of at least one cloud computing platform, which will provide the means for analysing demanding data sets and creating machine learning models.

For this reason, a brief introduction to AWS SageMaker is included, as a starting point for analyzing data on the AWS cloud.
