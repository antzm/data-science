# Excel Intro

## Decimal Point

When using Excel, the decimal point is represented either as a comma or a point. This is done automatically and it depends on the regional settings of each computer. Changing the regional seetings, the decimal point representation will automatically change.  

Thus, the decimal point will appear automatically as a comma or point, depending only on the computer where the Excel file will be opened and regardless of the regional settings of the computer where the Excel file had been created or it was last saved.

This means that Excel uses intenrally the proper notation for the correct representaiton of the decimal numbers.
