# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is used extensivelly in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Below, a few basic concepts are mentioned:

## Linear Equations

A system of linear equations, can be represented by using a matrix. 

For example, the linear equations

3x + 5y = 12
2x - 7y = 15

ca be represented by the matris

A = [[3,  5, 12],
     [2, -7, 15]]

This matrix, which contains both the coeffients of the unknowns and the constants of the equations, is called "Augmented Matrix"

To investigate if there are solutions for this system, and to find the solutions, we need to simplify this "Augmented Matrix" to a form called "REEF"

This simplified form, provides all the nessecary information needed to solve the system of linear equations, provided of course that a solution exists.
