# Probability and Statistics Main Concepts

## Probablilities

* Flipping a coin:
Every time we flip a coin, there's a 50% probablility that head will appear, and 50% probablility that tails will appear. In other words, the probablity for each outcome is 0.5 and so, the total probablility for both outcomes is 1, something which is very important in the probablility theory, as the sum of the indivdual outcomes is always 1, or 100%.

* Throwing a dice:
When we throw a dice, there are 6 different outcomes and each one has a probablility of 1/6 to appear. On the other hand, if we throw simmultaneously 2 dices, there are 6\*6=36 different outcomes, and so each outcome will have a probablility of 1/36 to appear.

* Picking a card:
When we pick a card from a set of playing cards, there's a probability of 1/52 to choose a specific card, as there are 52 cards in the playing set. All the cards have the same probablility to be chosen, so the probability of each card is the total probability, which by definition is always 1, divided by the number of cards which is 52.

## Probability distribution

The probailities of the different outcomes of a random event, will always add to 1 (or 100%), which means that always one of the possible outcomes will take place. For example, depending on the season and the current weather conditions, tommorow, for example, there will be a probability of 0.7 (70%) to rain and a probability of 0.3 (30%) not to rain, but either way, only one of those outcomes will be true.

There also some functions that are used in the probability theory, which help us to predict the outcome of various random events, and those functions are called "probablility distributions". The most common one is the Normal Distribution, which is a bell shaped didtribution used extensively in probablility and statistics.

The common thing in those probability distributions is in their graphs. The area in those graphs always equals 1, which reflects the fact that the outcomes of a random event will always add to 1. 

## Permutations
When the order does matter
	* Permutations with repetition
	* Permutations without repetition

Example 1:  
3 friends (A, B, C) go to a cinema and they sit next to each other.
Their seat arrangment could be either ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB or CBA.
*Permutations without repetition*

Example 2:
In football predictions, we mark each match as either 1, 2 or X. If there are e.g. 13 matches, then there will be 3*3*3*...*3 = 3^13 different results.
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 3a:
How many 5 letter words can we create, regardles if they have a meaning?
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 3b:
How many 5 letter words can we create, without using a letter twice, regardles if they have a meaning?
*Permutations without repetition*

Example 4a:
How many 5-digit numbers can we create, without using the zero?
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 4b:
How many 5-digit numbers can we create, without using a number twice and without using the zero?
*Permutations without repetition*

## Combinations
When the order doesnâ€™t matter
	* Combinations with repetition
	* Combinations without repetition

Example:  
From 5 students (A, B, C, D, E) we would like to select a team of 2 students to take part in a contest.
The diiferent teams could be either AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE. 
*Combinations without repetition*

## Normal distribution

The Normal distribution is the most widely used probability distribution, as it represents a wide variety of cases. For example:

* The time needed to go to work is represented by a normal distribution. Most days of the week it would be something close to a certain value, while rarely the time would be extremely longer or extremely shorter, compared to that value.

* The height of the trees in a forest is around a certain height, while very few trees are extremely tall or extremely short.

* The temperatures in a city are around a certain value, for every season, and only during fews days the temperatures are extrmemly height or extremely low, compared to their usual value.

The Normal distribution therefore can be used in many cases and its main characteristic is that it resembles a bell shaped distribution.

## Population vs Sample

In statistical terminology, a population is anything that we would like to study and thus, it can refer to people, animals, plants but also in any item we could think of.

If we would like to study the people living in a big city, the population we are interested in, is the population of that city. But if we would like to study the grades of the highschool students in that city, then the population we are interested in, is the population of the highschool students.

In a similar way, if we want to study the trees in a forest, then the population we are interested in, is the total number of threes in that forest. But if we would like to study only the fir trees in that forest, then we will define our population as the total number of fir trees in that forest. In case though we are interested only in the fir trees above 2 meters high, then we will define our population as the total number of fir trees in that forest that are above 2 meters height.
