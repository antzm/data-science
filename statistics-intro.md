# Probability and Statistics Main Concepts

## Probablilities

* Flipping a coin:
Every time we flip a coin, there's a 50% probablility that head will appear, and 50% probablility that tails will appear. In other words, the probablity for each outcome is 0.5 and so, the total probablility for both outcomes is 1, something which is very important in the probablility theory, as the sum of the indivdual outcomes is always 1, or 100%.

* Throwing a dice:
When we throw a dice, there are 6 different outcomes and each one has a probablility of 1/6 to appear. On the other hand, if we throw simmultaneously 2 dices, there are 6\*6=36 different outcomes, and so each outcome will have a probablility of 1/36 to appear.

* Picking a card:
When we pick a card from a set of playing cards, there's a probability of 1/52 to choose a specific card, as there are 52 cards in the playing set. All the cards have the same probablility to be chosen, so the probability of each card is the total probability, which by definition is always 1, divided by the number of cards which is 52.

## Permutations
When the order does matter
	* Permutations with repetition
	* Permutations without repetition

Example 1:  
3 friends (A, B, C) go to a cinema and they sit next to each other.
Their seat arrangment could be either ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB or CBA.
*Permutations without repetition*

Example 2:
In football predictions, we mark each match as either 1, 2 or X. If there are e.g. 13 matches, then there will be 3*3*3*...*3 = 3^13 different results.
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 3a:
How many 5 letter words can we create, regardles if they have a meaning?
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 3b:
How many 5 letter words can we create, without using a letter twice, regardles if they have a meaning?
*Permutations without repetition*

Example 4a:
How many 5-digit numbers can we create, without using the zero?
*Permutations with repetition*

Example 4b:
How many 5-digit numbers can we create, without using a number twice and without using the zero?
*Permutations without repetition*

## Combinations
When the order doesnâ€™t matter
	* Combinations with repetition
	* Combinations without repetition

Example:  
From 5 students (A, B, C, D, E) we would like to select a team of 2 students to take part in a contest.
The diiferent teams could be either AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE.
