# Probability and Statistics Main Concepts

**Permutations**
When the order does matter

Example 1:  
3 friends (A, B, C) go to a cinema and they sit next to each other.
Their seat arrangment could be either ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB or CBA.

Example 2:
In football predictions, we mark each match as either 1, 2 or X. If there are e.g. 13 matches, then there will be 3*3*3*...*3 = 3^13 different results.

**Combinations**
When the order doesnâ€™t matter

Example:  
From 5 students (A, B, C, D, E) we would like to select a team of 2 students to take part in a contest.
The diiferent teams could be either AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE.
